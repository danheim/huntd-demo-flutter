# Huntd Demo

The goal was to build a demo application with a basic login screen.

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application, contains:
- Login screen
- Forgot password screen (UI)
- Home screen, consists of: `Chat page` and `Profile page`.

You can log in to your account. Sign up credentials are hardcoded, for now.
After you are logged in, you can switch between two pages, and log out if you want.

Packages used:
- Provider (manage state globally): `AuthProvider`, `UserProvider`
- Google fonts
- Shared Preferences (store user data): `UserService`
